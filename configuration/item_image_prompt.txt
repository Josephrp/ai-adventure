# Item Image Prompt
# =================
#
# This prompt (except for the comment header) will be used to generate the game's item images.
#
# When it is run, it will have access to the following variables:
#
# - name:         The name of the item.
# - description:  The description of the item.
#
# To use these variables, enclose them in curly brackets, like this:

# You do not need to use all/any of the variables in your prompt.
#
# Have fun!
