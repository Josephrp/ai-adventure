# Camp Image Prompt
# =================
#
# This prompt (except for the comment header) will be used to generate the game's camp image.
#
# When it is run, it will have access to the following variables:
#
# - genre:        The genre of the game, set by the user during onboarding
# - tone:         The tone of the game, set by the user during onboarding
#
# To use these variables, enclose them in curly brackets, like this:
#
#     (pixel art), {tone}, {genre} camp.
#
# You do not need to use all/any of the variables in your prompt.
#
# Have fun!
#
# Set the below variable to true to replace prompt newlines with spaces.
