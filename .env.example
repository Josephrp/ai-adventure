# Steamship

# Max: I think the right way to connect to the game might be some script (deploy time? run time?) that uses
# our new TypeScript SDk to:
#
# Create-or-fetch a copy of STEAMSHIP_GAME_ENGINE_VERSION named STEAMSHIP_GAME_ENGINE_INSTANCE_NAME in workspace
# STEAMSHIP_GAME_ENGINE_INSTANCE_NAME.
#
# I collapsed the handle & version into a single string for STEAMSHIP_GAME_ENGINE_VERSION because that just feels
# like a more normal way to communicate than having a "ENGINE_HANDLE" and "ENGINE_VERSION" string.
#
# Then.. when you need to connect to the game engine, you just connect to the URL:
#
# https://{username}.steamship.run/{workspace}/{instance}/ as the baseUrl
